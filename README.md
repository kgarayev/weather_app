## :page_facing_up: Overview

The Weather App is a simple frontend application built using Vanilla JavaScript. It provides users with real-time weather data based on their geolocation. This project was developed within a limited timeframe of 2 hours, focusing on the core functionalities and asynchronous data retrieval from the weather API.

## :gear: Functionality

The Weather App offers the following features:

- Geolocation Retrieval: The app uses the browser's Geolocation API to obtain the user's current location.
- Weather Data Display: It communicates with a weather API to fetch and display the current weather information for the user's location.
- Conditional Rendering: While waiting for the asynchronous API data, a spinner or loading indicator is displayed to provide feedback to the user.

Please note that minimal time was allocated to developing the app's features and no styling has been applied. The focus was on quickly implementing the core functionalities using Vanilla JavaScript.

## :rocket: Opportunities for Improvement

The Weather App presents various opportunities for improvement and expansion:

- Styling: Enhance the visual appearance of the app by applying CSS styling and creating a more appealing user interface.
- Responsiveness: Ensure that the app is fully responsive across different devices to provide a seamless experience to users on both desktop and mobile platforms.
- Additional Functionality: Consider adding more features, such as allowing users to input a location by text, implementing validation for user input, and adding interactive elements for a richer user experience.
